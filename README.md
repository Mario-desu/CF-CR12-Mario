Dear trainers,

I hope you like it :-). 
In the Navbar click on "Add a Destination" to do so. By clicking on API you will get to the API (bonus points). You can also ad the id in the URL to filter.

Below that you will find Serri's joke. It will show a different a different one, when clicking on the button or refreshing the page.
Below that you will find all destinations in the database in cards. You can find some Infos there, but more when you click on details. On the details-page you will also find the map with the pointer to the selected destination
You can easily change the destinations after clicking on the edit-icon or delete after clicking on the bin-icon.
So I hope I didn't forget any details.



Have a nice day,

regards.

Mario
